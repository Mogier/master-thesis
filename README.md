# master-thesis
This master thesis was done in the context of the double master degree Informatique - Information und Kommunikation (IFIK), which brings together two Master programs : a degree in computer engineering at the National Institute of Applied Sciences in Lyon (INSA Lyon) and a Master in Informatik (Schwerpunkt : Information und Kommunikationssysteme) at the University of Passau.

The repository has 2 sub-projects :
  - passau/ which contains the master thesis required in the german side (called MasterArbeit) and which is research-oriented.
  - lyon/ which contains a smaller report for the french side (rapport PFE), engineering-oriented.

I used the LaTeX template available [here](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/masters-doctoral-thesis) for the MasterArbeit and LNCS LaTeX [class](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0) for the PFE. I also used the SublimeText's plugin [LaTeXTools](https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools).

PS : English isn't my mother tongue :)
