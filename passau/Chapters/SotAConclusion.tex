In this State of the Art part, we've reviewed the generalities about the Semantic Web and presented several online semantic resources. We've also study the implementation of different similarity measures based on a generic ontology as well as their advantages and drawbacks regarding the the potential use-case. Then, we've shortly explain how the disambiguation process is achieve and how the previous measures can be used in it. Finally we've presented three approaches for semantic enrichment.\\

We will now propose a contribution to the topic by compiling all the notions we previously studied.
