\section{Context}
This PFE was done in the context of the double master degree Informatique - Information und Kommunikation (IFIK), which brings together two Master programs : a degree in computer engineering at the National Institute of Applied Sciences in Lyon (INSA Lyon) and a Master in Informatik (Schwerpunkt : Information und Kommunikationssysteme) at the University of Passau.\\

I realised my project at the University of Passau during the last semester of my 5th year of study. During these 6 months, I had the amazing opportunity to discover the way of study in Germany and the organization of the University of Passau. There are 12,000 students in Passau (for 50,000 inhabitants) and \textbf{XXX} study computer science. The FIM faculty (Fakültät für Informatik und Mathematik) is composed of \textbf{XXX} chairs, I was part of Pr. Kosch's which currently employ \textbf{XXX} master students and \textbf{XXX} doctors students from different countries (one of the student I shared the office with was from Tunisia).\\

I worked on my own on this project under the supervision of two tutors, Dr. David Coquil on the german side and Dr. Elöd Egyed-Zsigmond on the french side. They were a precious help during the whole PFE process in term of advices and suggestions of work.
